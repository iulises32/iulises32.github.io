      <description>My Hobbies I really love physics and mathematics, so most of the time I am studying or doing exercises/homework. When I was in middle school I remember doing a lot of problems of mathematics, not only about the current topics but of advanced themes. But when I am not doing anything of that, I like to spend my time doing some of the following things (not in that particular order):</description>

      <description>My academic life I&amp;rsquo;m not gonna talk about elementary school because there is no much to say, so I prefer to talk about the next 3 degrees, Middle school, High school and University.
Middle School It was one of my best stages of life, for not say the best. I went to a semi-boarding school, I was in there from Monday to Friday all the day, I slept and ate there.</description>

      <description>Contests and competitions Not everything was horrible in high school, well&amp;hellip; the curricular things only. At high school I participated at some contests and competitions about Physics and mathematics, actually it was of all the types, state, national and international. In this competitions I learned a lot, not only academic knowledge but to lose, to fight to be the best, to work under pression and to think creatively.
Silvia Torres contest My current university each even semester organizes a contest for all the students of the state that are in middle and high school.</description>

      <description>Who am I? I am Ulises Israel Zárate López, a 20 year old boy who lives in Mexico. I am currently studying Physics in the local university of my state, in 4th semester to be precise, almost finishing it. I have two older brothers, a sister and a brother, with whom I live together with my mother. My dad passed away when a I was 6.  What I like I love all the sciences but more physics and mathematics, the feeling of solving a problem after multiple hours of trying solving it makes me feel really good, and even more when everything fits and makes sense; that feeling when you finally understand what is going on.</description>

      <description>My furry friend Something that equates with my love for physics are cats, I really love them, they are cute, funny, playful, curious, etc. Since I was a kid I&amp;rsquo;ve loved cats, they are fluffy and adorable, although sometimes are little demons that love the chaos, but who can blame them? For their cuteness everything is forgiven.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had other pets, actually a lot: birds, fishes, turtles, hamsters (a lot), rabbits, dogs, and chickens, but no one is compared with cats.</description>
