      <description>My furry friend Something that equates with my love for physics are cats, I really love them, they are cute, funny, playful, curious, etc. Since I was a kid I&amp;rsquo;ve loved cats, they are fluffy and adorable, although sometimes are little demons that love the chaos, but who can blame them? For their cuteness everything is forgiven.
I&amp;rsquo;ve had other pets, actually a lot: birds, fishes, turtles, hamsters (a lot), rabbits, dogs, and chickens, but no one is compared with cats.</description>
